## 🏛️ Backend Canisters (Complete)

### 1. NFT Certificates (`nft_certificates`)
**Purpose**: Digital certificates and achievements as NFTs
- Create and mint NFT certificates
- Track certificate issuance and ownership
- Store certificate metadata and verification data
- Support for multiple certificate types

### 2. User Management (`user_management`)
**Purpose**: User authentication and role management
- User registration and authentication
- Role-based access control (Student, Parent, Teacher, Admin)
- User profile management
- Email and contact management

### 3. Student Records (`student_records`) - **PRODUCTION READY**
**Purpose**: Complete student data management system with **StableBTreeMap storage**
- **Student Enrollment**: Complete profiles with medical info, emergency contacts
- **Academic Records**: Subject grades, GPA tracking, performance analytics
- **Attendance System**: Daily tracking with summary statistics
- **Transfer Requests**: Multi-approval workflow (parent → school → admin)
- **School Management**: School profiles with capacity tracking
- **Analytics & Reporting**: Performance insights and statistics

### 🔧 **Storage**: StableBTreeMap (Persistent Across Upgrades)
The backend implements **StableBTreeMap** as the primary storage mechanism, ensuring:
- **Data Persistence**: All student records persist across canister upgrades
- **Scalability**: Efficient storage for thousands of students and records
- **Reliability**: No data loss during deployments or updates
- **Performance**: Fast read/write operations for real-time applications
